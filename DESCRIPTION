Description: Implements a ridge penalization scheme to improve the numerical 
    stability of conditional maximum likelihood estimation for Beta 
    Autoregressive Moving Average (BARMA) models. The penalty term enhances 
    the curvature of the log-likelihood function, reducing the risk of 
    convergence failures and implausible estimates. The package also provides 
    a bootstrap-based parameter estimation strategy as a complementary solution. 
    These tools are designed to replicate the analysis and methods presented in 
    Cribari-Neto, Costa, and Fonseca (2025).
