\title{Generate Initial Values for βARMA Model Estimation}
\usage{
start_values(y, link, ar = NA, ma = NA, X = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A numeric time series with values in the open interval (0, 1).}

\item{link}{A string specifying the link function for the mean, such as
`"logit"`, `"probit"`, or `"cloglog"`.}

\item{ar}{A numeric vector of autoregressive (AR) lags. Defaults to `NA`
for models without an AR component.}

\item{ma}{A numeric vector of moving average (MA) lags. Defaults to `NA`
for models without an MA component.}

\item{X}{An optional numeric matrix or data frame of exogenous
variables (regressors).}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector containing the initial values for the model
parameters (`alpha`, `varphi`, `theta`, `phi`, `beta`), ready to be
used by an optimization routine. Returns `NULL` if the model
specification is not recognized.
}
\description{
This function calculates reasonable starting values for the parameters of
various Beta Autoregressive Moving Average (βARMA) models. The method is
based on the approach proposed by Ferrari & Cribari-Neto (2004) for
beta regression, adapted here for the time series context.
}
\details{
The function computes initial values by fitting a linear model
(`lm.fit`) to the link-transformed response variable `g(y)`.
This provides a computationally cheap and stable way to initialize the
main optimization algorithm.

The specific procedure depends on the model's structure:
\itemize{
  \item For models with autoregressive (AR) terms, the lagged values of
    the transformed series `g(y)` are used as predictors to estimate
    the initial `alpha` (intercept) and `varphi` (AR) coefficients.
  \item If exogenous variables `X` are included, they are added as
    predictors in the linear model to obtain initial `beta` values.
  \item Moving average (MA) coefficients (`theta`) are initialized to zero,
    a standard practice in ARMA model estimation.
  \item The initial value for the precision parameter `phi` is derived
    from the variance of the residuals of the initial linear fit,
    following the methodology from Ferrari & Cribari-Neto (2004).
  \item For a pure βMA model (no AR or X components), a simpler method is
    used where `alpha` is the mean of `g(y)` and `phi` is based on the
    unconditional variance of `y`.
}

This function is called internally by the main model fitting function
but is exported for standalone use and inspection.
